## Dataset

I utilized the "automobiles.csv" dataset, containing detailed information about various cars, including make, horsepower, fuel type, engine size, and price.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The project begins with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python's pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. The visualizations include scatter plots examining the relationship between horsepower, price, and other features.

## Top Brands Analysis

The analysis identifies the top brands with the highest-priced cars. A bar plot showcases the top 10 brands based on the highest-priced cars in the dataset.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the relationships between car characteristics and prices. It serves as a demonstration of my data analysis and visualization skills, showcasing the steps taken to explore and interpret the provided dataset.
